After a few weeks of tying to hack together P*ersonal FInance Wallet*, I’ve realised a few things.

First, It is easy to get lost in the number of platforms, SDKs, and the how-tos of how to build a wallet. I started building *Personal Finance Wallet* on *Spark* (by Lightspark). Seemed like the best thing to do at the time because of the number of wallet companies that started experimenting with it. But upon reviewing online threads and the technical docs, that doesn’t seem to be the best idea. Self-custody needs to be TRULY SELF-CUSTODY, and there’s still parts of the docs that make me doubt the inner workings of *Spark.* I’ll also to experiment with the BreezSDK and maybe a few others before settling on something on what I’d use officially. Since I’m building this as Open-Source, I’d love for anyone with the technical expertise in building wallets to kindly reach out and chat. I think many people could use an app that assists them to make the best financial decisions they could make.

Second, there’s so much to consider in terms of features. Basic features alone would hurt the adoption of *Personal Finance Wallet*, yet too many features would also be an overkill and I doubt I’d be able to progress to the real meat of the application, which is, using AI to assist users in the financial management of their lives. I believe that would be the hook that catches many users.

And finally, I think I need to build this app as peer-to-peer software without servers or any centralization whatsoever. I’m still learning about *Pear* and *Bare* by Tether, and learning how to build apps like that. I believe that would be a good way to prevent this *FOSS* from entering a phase where we need to have a database for user accounts, especially as AI would have to learn user data. With *QVAC* by Tether, it would be possible to have this wallet use local AI on the user device and learn all user actions and suggest very good financial habits. Can’t wait for the *QVAC* SDK to go live

So, with that, **<mark>pray for me</mark>** that I’d be able to keep building this and receive the needed to support to see this to the end. I believe it would empower many.

A self-custodial wallet that is secure and without centralization whatsoever, provides access to numerous DeFi protocols (lending, borrowing, saving and investing) and has an assistant that leads you through good financial habits unto stable and sustainable wealth — that’s the goal.
