This is my idea of where finance is headed in the coming decades. I believe wallet companies are going to become fintech-like and would provide users great opportunities to lend, borrow and invest at lightning speed. With the great breakthroughs that bitcoin, ethereum and web3 in general are making, sooner rather than later, there will be many personal (and business) finance companies that would be built on web3 infrastructure.

I believe these technologies would eat the world of finance soon: Bitcoin, ZK-Starks and any innovation to scale these for the masses.

This app is my attempt to build something like that.

It is meant to consolidate the entire financial life of the user in one app. It is a self-custodial wallet built on the Spark SDK by Lightspark and Starknet. Currently it only has Bitcoin, USDT & STRK integrated. Since integrating actual buy/sell features requires creating a developer account with TRANSAK and the like, I’m working on getting that soon.

Working Features

1. Creating multiple wallets
    
2. Sending and receiving BTC, USDT and STRK
    
3. Language and Currency options
    
4. Seedphrase management and wallet recovery
    
5. Dark-mode (I just couldn’t resist adding that…lol)
    
6. Wallet transaction history
    

Upcoming Features

1. Activity notifications
    
2. Fiat/bank/mobile money options would be added
    
3. Integrations into bank apps and bill payment apps would also be added
    
4. An AI personal finance guru would be integrated to learn user data and recommend changes to financial lifestyle and suggest income opportunities
    
5. An integration interface that will allow this wallet to be integrated into other apps like RateCardly and the like
